Welcome! I am a Research Associate at the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit at the University of Glasgow and a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow. I develop methods to assess causality in population health research and evaluate the health impacts of social policies.

I work at the intersection of epidemiology, causal inference, and evidence synthesis. My research helps policymakers and researchers understand whether social policies—like cash transfers, housing programs, and parental support—actually improve health outcomes. Some of the topics I explore include:

- Developing causal assessment frameworks for systematic reviews
- Income inequality and health outcomes
- Policy evaluation methods for real-world interventions
- Bridging research evidence with government decision-making

Currently, I lead evidence synthesis projects and co-design evaluation plans with local and regional governments across the UK. My approach combines rigorous causal inference methods with practical tools that work in messy, real-world policy contexts.

My research has appeared in journals including the *Milbank Quarterly*, *Research Synthesis Methods*, *European Journal of Epidemiology*, and *The Lancet Public Health*, and has informed policy evaluation efforts across Scotland and the UK.

## Background

I completed my PhD at the University of Glasgow in 2023, where my thesis developed methods for assessing causality in systematic reviews. The work was recognized with the Joseph Black Medal and Hird Prize for the top PhD thesis in the Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences Graduate School. I hold an MSc in Health Systems and Public Policy from the University of Edinburgh and a BEng in Biomedical Engineering from City, University of London.

Beyond research, I teach on the Master of Public Health program at the University of Edinburgh, where I've been involved in courses on complex interventions, R programming, and systematic reviews.
