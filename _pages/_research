## Project Overview

This British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship project explores the relationship between homes, households, and health by evaluating the impact of energy efficiency measures (EEMs) on vulnerable populations in Scotland. The project harnesses Scotland's administrative data infrastructure to link address-level property data with individual-level health records—a methodological innovation that opens new possibilities for understanding how our homes affect our health.

**Duration:** 2025-2028 (3 years)  
**Funding:** British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship (£356,905)  
**Institution:** MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow

## Background

Young children and older adults are particularly susceptible to poor housing conditions. While government-backed energy efficiency schemes primarily aim to reduce carbon emissions and fuel poverty, local governments increasingly view them as tools for improving health. However, the evidence is mixed—some studies show health benefits while others find no effect, and there are important methodological concerns around the existing evidence base.

This project will use natural experimental methods to evaluate whether EEMs improve health outcomes for children under 5 and adults over 65 living in treated homes across Scotland.

## Research Questions

**RQ1:** What are the considerations needed to estimate the health effect of government-backed EEMs on households in Scotland?

**RQ2:** What is the effect of government-backed EEMs on the health of young children and older adults living in treated homes?

**RQ3:** What factors help explain the variance in effects of EEMs on health outcomes?

**RQ4:** What are the future uses of address-level and individual-level data linkages to explore the link between housing, homes, and health?

## Methods

The project uses **controlled interrupted time series** designs, comparing post-2015 health outcomes of individuals in homes treated with government-backed EEMs to projections from 2008 onwards. A matched control group living in untreated but similar homes will be included.

### Study Population

- **Children <5 years:** ~58,000 children living in ~500,000 treated homes
- **Adults >65 years:** ~212,000 older adults living in treated homes

### Key Datasets

- Home Energy Efficiency Database (HEED)
- Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) register
- Scottish health records (SMR01, A&E, GP out of hours)
- Child Health Surveillance Programme (CHSP-PS)
- Prescribing Information System (PIS)

## Work Packages

### WP1: Describing and Exploring Data
- Evaluability assessment workshops with stakeholders
- Data linkage and quality assessment
- Cohort profile of individuals in EEM-treated homes

### WP2: Children Under 5
**Health outcomes:**
- Child development (e.g., developmental concerns at 27-30 months)
- Physical health (e.g., unintentional injuries)
- Health-seeking behaviors (e.g., vaccination uptake, dental attendance)

### WP3: Adults Over 65
**Health outcomes:**
- Falls and injuries
- Cardiovascular events
- Respiratory disease
- Mortality
- Prescriptions for stroke and respiratory conditions

## Cross-Cutting Activities

### Health and Housing Research Network
I'm establishing an expert research network across the UK to explore applications of address-level datasets. The network will hold quarterly seminars where researchers present methodological insights and applications, culminating in a showcasing event to strengthen collaborations and identify future research priorities.

### Public Engagement
Public engagement workshops will explore:
- Attitudes toward using administrative data to identify households needing improvements
- Policy priorities for data linkages (e.g., developing decent homes standards)
- Future research questions most relevant to communities

## Expected Impact

This project will:
- Provide robust causal evidence on whether EEMs improve health outcomes
- Demonstrate innovative methods for linking property and health data
- Build research capacity through the cross-disciplinary network
- Inform housing and health policy decisions across the UK
- Identify which households and populations benefit most from EEMs

## Updates

Project updates, blog posts, and findings will be shared here as the work progresses.
