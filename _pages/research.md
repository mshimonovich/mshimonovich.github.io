## Current Research

### British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship
**Energy Efficiency Measures and Health Outcomes** (2025-2028)

I'm leading a three-year research project examining how energy efficiency interventions affect health outcomes across different populations. This work sits at the intersection of housing policy, environmental health, and causal inference methods.

The project addresses a crucial gap in our understanding: while we know that poor housing conditions affect health, we have limited causal evidence about whether energy efficiency improvements actually lead to better health outcomes—and for whom. This matters because governments are investing substantial resources in home energy upgrades, often with health improvement as a key justification.

My approach combines systematic review methods with advanced causal inference techniques to rigorously assess the health impacts of energy efficiency measures. I'm particularly interested in understanding how effects vary across different population groups and whether certain types of interventions work better than others.

This fellowship is supported by the British Academy (£356,905) and the Lord Kelvin Adam Smith Leadership Fellowship (£100,000).

## Research Interests

I develop and apply methods to assess causality in population health research. My work focuses on:

- **Causal inference frameworks** for systematic reviews and evidence synthesis
- **Policy evaluation methods** for real-world social interventions
- **Income inequality and health** - understanding causal pathways
- **Bridging research and policy** - translating evidence for decision-makers

I work with local and regional governments across the UK to co-design evaluation plans for social policies, including cash transfers, housing programs, and family support initiatives. The goal is to create rigorous but practical evaluation designs that work in messy, real-world policy contexts.
